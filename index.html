<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>PushButton Engine is an open source, flash game framework from <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/">PushButton Labs</a>. We use it in our own products, along with industry leaders like Zynga, Playdom/Disney, RockYou, hive7, and others. In total, PBE has powered hundreds of millions of game experiences.</p>

<p>PBE is designed to make it easy to integrate existing libraries and build gameplay on top of them. Check out the documentation for more details. PBE comes in two flavors: PBE 1.0, the classic battle tested option, and PBE 2.0, the new, lightweight, and refined version.</p>
